**AssetDuJour** is a plugin for Movable Type to preselect the date « du jour » (today) in the asset upload path.

# Why?

With the default behavior of MT, authors tend to upload all assets in the same place: the Site Root (or the Archive Root if it is setup). It clutters this folder and increases the risk of adversely overwriting an existing file while uploading an asset with the same name.
With Asset Du Jour, the default path in the upload asset form will be either &lt;Site Root>/YYYY/MM/DD or &lt;Archive Root>/YYYY/MM/DD depending how the archives are configured, with YYYY/MM/DD set to today.

# Installation

AssetDuJour works with MT 4.2+ (it works with MT 5.0 too).

* Download <a href="http://github.com/padawan/AssetDuJour/">AssetDuJour</a>
* Uncompress and copy the AssetDuJour folder into your MT plugins directory.
* Et voilà !

# Parlez-vous français ?
